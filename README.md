# Advent Of Code
I created this repository to share my solves for the advent of code puzzles posted at [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/). Language used might vary but currently all 2019 samples are written in Javascript meant to be executed in [node.js](https://nodejs.org).

### How I'm Storing Samples
The repository contains a year folder for the year of the puzzles and a folder for each day of the advent calendar. Generally speaking each folder will contain a main-01.js and main-02.js script which is the base for part 1 and part 2 of each puzzle.

### Running the Samples
Within each daily folder start by running the following script to install any packages required by the scripts.

```bash
npm install
```

After installing packages, you can execute the samples by running:

```bash
node main-01.js
node main-02.js
```

If you have any questions, or suggestions for how I might improve the solves that I have listed, please post an issue here on my github page or reach out to me on twitter at https://twitter.com/joshuapiercecom

Happy Code Holidays!
